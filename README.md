# Razorpay-website
A modern Razorpay-website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates Razorpay’s sleek and animated user interface — featuring sticky navigations, hover effects, stacking cards on page scroll, infinite horizontal scrolling, slider images, and 180° rotating cards — all designed to showcase interactive front-end development skills.
